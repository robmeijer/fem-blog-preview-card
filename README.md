## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Getting more familiar with using `clamp()` for responsive font sizes.

Also used the `:has()` pseudo-class for the first time.

### Continued development
I had some issues getting the image cropped as expected for the mobile layout. I'm not sure whether my proposed solution
is "correct", but it works. Would like to understand this better.

### Useful resources
- [Kevin Powell's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)\
  Kevin is an amazing teacher, and I based my solution on his many excellent examples.
